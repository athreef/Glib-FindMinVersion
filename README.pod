=head1 NAME

Glib::FindMinVersion - Find minimum version of GLib needed to compile C source


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Glib::FindMinVersion;

    print Glib::FindMinVersion::with('g_get_num_processors'); # 2.36
    print scalar Glib::FindMinVersion::for_file('source.c'); # 2.18
    my %symbols = Glib::FindMinVersion::for_file('source.c' => 2.10);
    # (
    #   2.18 => [qw[g_set_error_literal]],
    #   2.12 => [qw[g_ascii_strtoll g_base64_decode]],
    # )
    

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Symbol use is detected quite crudely with C<< / \s* (?<symbol>\w+) \s* \( /x >>. Symbols introduced prior to 2.0 are labelled as 2.0.

=head1 METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item with(@symbols)

Returns minimum GLib version which exports all C<@symbols>.

=item for_source($source [, $version])

Here, C<[]> denotes an optional argument.
In list context, returns a listing of all found glib symbols grouped by version. If C<$version> is given, the list is limited to symbols newer than C<$version>. C<$version> is a string of the form C</2\.\d\d?/>.

In scalar context, returns the maximum version in the list, which is the minimum version required to use all the symbols.

=item for_file($filename [, $version])

Helper function that reads in C<$filename> and passes it to C<for_source>.

=head1 NAMING

Official casing is GLib, but there's a Glib module already on CPAN, so this follows suit. This and the L<Glib> module are unrelated though.
